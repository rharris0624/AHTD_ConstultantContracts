	<h1>What are claims?</h1>
	<p>A claim, within the context of security, is a piece of information about you
	as vouched by someone else.</p>
	<p>The classic example of this is a driver's license. It makes several claims
	about you, such as your name and birth date, and is vouched by your state DMV
	or equivalent. The vouching is key: it is what makes a driver's license useful
	for purchasing liquor. A piece of paper or even a fancy plastic card you printed
	up yourself wouldn't fly with the liquor store clerk.</p>
	<h2>How are these claims about me used?</h2>
	<p>Our applications need similar information about you at times to better
	customize your experience, but this information cannot just be from anybody.
	The AHTD STS exists to be the DMV in this case, vouching for the claims it issues.
	Our apps trust it to be right.</p>
	<h2>What info about me is sent?</h2>
	<p>Each application only receives claims that it needs. Some may want your
	employee number and others your email address. Virtually all of them will want
	your Windows Account Name (the one you use to log in to your machine) and a
	role. This role is unique to each application, and both signifies your
	permission to use the given app as well as in what way.</p>
	<p>Only claims for common employee information are ever sent. Claim types include
	the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>First and/or last name</li>
		<li>Windows account</li>
		<li>Employee #</li>
		<li>Budget(s)</li>
		<li>Email (only ever your @arkansashighways.com address)</li>
		<li>District location</li>
	</ul>
